# ESEA-Dark-Theme
A custom dark theme for ESEA.net.

## Installation
This is just a `style.css` file so it's installed as you would typically expect, with a browser extension such as Stylish. [You can install it from my UserStyles page here.](https://userstyles.org/styles/140398/esea-dark-theme-updated-for-2018?utm_campaign=stylish_stylepage)

## Hey, the theme isn't working as expected?
I'm sadly just not as active as I used to be on ESEA, meaning that I might not pick up on bugs or theme-breaking changes from ESEA as fast as others. If something changes that breaks this theme or you notice a bug, I encourage you to leave an issue on the issue tracker [here](https://github.com/Snaacky/ESEA-Dark-Theme/issues/new) so that I can continue to update and maintain the theme.

## Latest updates from UserStyles
* Fixed site poll not showing full width and submit being cut off.
* Fixed match information on matches being pushed below team and team members.
* Fixed game filters clipping through the region drop down.
* Rounded game filter icons so they don't stick out.

## Credits
I did not initally create this dark theme, all credits goes to [Michal Walko](mailto:mike.sebastian.walko@gmail.com) who originally created it and maintained it up until 2015-2016. I simply picked it up after finding it in an unmainted state and started added my own improvements to it.
